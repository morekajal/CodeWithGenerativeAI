- I am trying to learn Google Cloud Platform w.r.t VertexAI and GenAI Applications
- Will try to cover the basics of the GCP and how to use Gemini Models along with different Google API's available
- For this, one will need a Google Cloud Platform account login to start with the learning activities.
