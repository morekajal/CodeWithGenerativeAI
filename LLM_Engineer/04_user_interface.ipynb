      "1. **Data collection**: You collect a large dataset of examples related to the problem you want to solve (e.g., images of cats vs. dogs).\n",
      "2. **Model creation**: You create a neural network with many layers, each consisting of multiple neurons.\n",
      "3. **Training**: The model is trained on the collected data, where it's shown example after example and told what the correct output should be.\n",
